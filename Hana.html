      <p>We left Syria in 2012. First, we settled in Jordan, where we stayed for five years. Then in 2016, we came to the United States, to this neighborhood, where we have stayed ever since. An organization called ACDC helped us — a woman met us at the airport, along with a translator from Iraq. They knew us right away from our many suitcases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither I nor my husband could speak any English when we first arrived.
      </p><p>
        The woman and the translator brought us to this neighborhood and to our apartment. ACDC assisted us for three months.
      </p><p>
        Ekram was not working during this time, but he was looking for a job — any kind of job. Meanwhile, he took English classes. While attending these classes, he received money every month. When he stopped attending school and began to work, the money stopped. He took classes for two months. In those classes, he met an Arabic man whose brother was a car mechanic. He invited Ekram to work with him, and he took the job so that he could pay another three months rent.
      </p><p>
        I also went to this same school for two months. Then I left to take care of my children. While in class I would have to leave my children home alone. They would stay by the door of the apartment waiting for me to return. I was afraid for them, so I stopped going to class and wanted to find someone to come to the house to tutor me.
      </p><p>
        ACDC enrolled the children in school as soon as we arrived. Every day, someone would come to the house to take the children to school.
      </p><p>
        When we first arrived in the neighborhood, we didn’t know anyone. For five days, we thought we were all alone. Then after a week, ACDC told us that there was another Syrian family nearby. After that, ACDC told me about every family that moved to the neighborhood so that I could get in contact with them.
      </p><p>
        I love this neighborhood. I have made lots of friends. We go shopping together. One speaks French, one is an Afghan woman, one is a woman from Sudan, and there are a few from Syria — twenty families in all — but some have moved outside of the neighborhood now. All of us were refugees, including some from Jordan, Egypt and two from Turkey.
      </p><p>
        I last saw my brother seven years ago in Jordan — now he lives in Germany — but I have not seen the rest of my family since we were all in Syria together ten years ago. I have no family in America.

        School was very hard for the children at first. They could not communicate with the other American children. There were a lot of Syrian kids, however, and they would speak in Arabic with them to make them feel at home.
      </p><p>
        But then I told them that they wouldn’t learn anything if they kept speaking in Arabic. They had to learn English. So they listened to me and started practicing English so they could learn alongside the other children. They learned slowly at first, but now they speak English well.
      </p><p>
        The organization sent us two friends — a man and a woman — to tutor the kids and myself.
      </p><p>
        My children really like school now. Every time they go on vacation, they miss their teachers and friends.
      </p><p>
        School was very hard when it was online, however. We didn’t have a great internet connection, but then the school gave us WiFi, and that helped. After a while, my children got used to online school, and they benefited from it.

          I want to work, but I have young children. I regret that I left school when I did, but I was pregnant with my youngest child. In sha Allah I could go back one day. People who stayed in school received money, and I would have continued earning money and could have put my daughter in the school with me. But because I was pregnant and because we moved apartments I couldn't return.
        </p><p>
          I used to go twice a week to the library where I could take English classes through a church community. I loved those classes. But now because of Covid the classes are online.
        </p><p>
          I must have learned a lot of English, because when I went to the hospital with my daughter, I could understand the nurse and doctor. When I take my kids to school, I can understand the teachers. Even street signs and directions — I can understand those too. In the past, I couldn’t understand my French and Afghan neighbors. I took French long ago, but I can only speak a few words. But now that we all speak English, we understand each other. So when their children play with my children or when neighbors come to the door asking for things, I understand anything they say.
