      <p>Over the past five years, I have been privileged to get to know several members of the Syrian refugee community around the DC area. I first met these families as a high school student studying Arabic; I was looking for ways to practice Arabic, and they were looking for ways to practice English. Also around that time, I and members of my church community were hosting monthly Arabic language dinners. Soon, we invited these refugee families to join us, and Middle East Friends was born. Middle East Friends (MEF) was a monthly, cultural exchange program in which members of my church community and the refugee community would tour a prominent cultural site in DC followed by a communal meal. We would pay some of the refugee families to cater the meal for us. These monthly dinners, as well as occasions in which we were invited to our Syrian friends’ homes for dinner and an annual multicultural Thanksgiving, are some of the most formative experiences I had in high school. In particular, I was struck by our refugee friends’ incredible generosity and the continual welcome that they extended to us even though they were the newcomers. These experiences of hospitality, of inviting and being invited into homes, of sharing meals, and of exchanging stories and traditions taught me the power of hospitality as a community-building force. Hospitality fostered diverse friendships, integration without assimilation, and an environment of mutual respect and benefit. Based on my own experiences, as well as research, I believe that by practicing hospitality, residents of the United States can move beyond barriers and politicized rhetoric and into community with their neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today’s society, immigrants and refugees are often caught in the rhetorical crossfire between polarized political parties and ideologies. A 2018 Atlantic article called immigration “the most prominent wedge issue in America” (Nicholson). On one side, many clamor for bans and walls because of fears over job loss and increased drug and crime rates. On the other side, many demand an opening of the country because of the economic and cultural benefits that immigrants and refugees provide. Many still harbor frustration and resentment from the 2008 recession, and Trump’s polarizing presidency only exacerbated this divide. In addition, fear and mistrust toward Muslim refugees and immigrants in particular lingers twenty years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. These factors, although by no means comprehensive, have contributed toward the complicated attitudes toward refugees and immigrants in the U.S. today.
      </p>
      <h4>Assimilation vs. Integration</h4>
      <p>
        In 2018, in the midst of Donald Trump’s presidency and increasing anti-Muslim sentiments in Europe, theologian and professor Dr. Matthew Kaemingk published Christain Hospitality and Muslim Immigration in an Age of Fear. In his book, Kaemingk examines varying attitudes toward immigration in the West, from fear-based nationalism to idealized multiculturalism, and argues instead for a new approach: Christian pluralism rooted in hospitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kaemingk begins his book with an overview of the clash between Islam and liberal Europe and the gradual shift in Europeans’ attitudes away from multiculturalism and integration and toward monoculturalism and assimilation. In 2011, politicians such as Angela Merkel, David Cameron, and Nicolas Sarkozy “began to argue that Europe needed to stand up for secular liberalism and force Islam to a point of deicsion—either integrate or go home” (Kaemingk 30). These politicians voiced the popular public opinion of the day:
      </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy048.nclive.org/lib/davidson/detail.action?docID=5210871" style="margin:1rem;">“Islam—not Europe—must change. Europe is taken for granted. Europe is the end of history. Europe has settled, once and for all, the fundamental questions of sex, family, politics, religion, and the good life. The proper task of the European state is to educate Muslims on the answers they have already found” (Kaemingk 10-11).</blockquote>
      <p>
        Rather than seeking to accommodate the differences that Islam brough to the table, Europeans wanted to either eradicate the difference or exclude Muslims entirely. They lost faith in the rhetoric of multiculturalism and called for complete assimilation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past several decades, the U.S. has undergone a similar shift in attitude toward Muslims. After 9/11, the U.S.’ goal became the “reformulation of Islam,” as professor of Islamic history and Christian-Muslim relations Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad writes in Becoming American? : The Forging of Arab and Muslim Identity in Pluralist America. The U.S. government sought to “identify, one might even say create, a ‘moderate Islam,’ one that is definitively different from that espoused by those who perpetrated the attacks and justified their actions by reference to the religion of Islam” (Haddad 1). In 2016, five years after Merkel, Cameron, and Sarkozy’s consensus about Muslims in Europe, U.S. president Donald Trump called “not only to halt all Islamic immigration into the United States but to form a national database to register and track all Muslims in the country” (Kaemingk 31). What would have been “roundly condemned by both parties as bigoted and fundamentally anti-American” is now representative of the current opinion (31).
      </p>
      <p>
        In both Europe and the U.S., popular opinion now calls for hegemony and uniformity, even as people claim to celebrate diversity. Even as Western culture celebrates diversity of color, religion, sexuality, and political ideologies, it seeks to smother the differences presented by those whose beliefs and traditions clash with progressive morality and uniformity. This tension can create a deeply hostile environment for immigrants and refugees who come from very different backgrounds and for whom cultural and religious customs and ideologies are foundational to a sense of identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, it is important to note that Kaemingk’s book focuses on Muslim immigration in pariticular. He does not speak as much to the experiences of non-Muslim immigrants and refugees in the West. Because of my interests in Arabic and the Middle East, and because of my connections with several Muslim, Middle Eastern refugee families, I am especially interested in their experiences and Western attitudes toward them. That being said, I want to acknowledge that not all Arab immigrants and refugees are Muslim, and some aren’t religious at all. One of the refugee families that I interviewed for this project comes from a Christian background, and I have met many others with diverse beliefs. “Muslim” refers to an individual that adheres to the beliefs of Islam. “Arab” refers to “all who speak the Arabic language and identify with Arab history and culture, regardless of whether they are Muslims, Christians, or Jews” (Haddad 17). Regardless of an immigrant or refugee’s religious or personal beliefs, however, the importance of extending hospitality does not change; instead, it becomes even more important because it is a demonstration of unconditional welcome.
      </p>
      <h4>The Solution: Hospitality</h4>
      <p>
        Because the West has turned to such a binary “assimilate or leave” mindset to cope with difference, Kaemingk introduces an alternative route, calling instead for a Christian pluralist counterculture to question majority opinions and establish a culture of hospitality and welcome.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> He wants his readers to see “what the politics of walls and doors have been missing all along: a table” (305). “Well-functioning tables,” he writes, “will not dissolve our differences, but they will dissolve our hierarchies. Well-functioning tables will encourage both guests and hosts to shed their labels and begin to call each other by a new name, a category unknown in modern political theory—friend” (305).
      </p>
      <p>
        This concept of hospitality, of well-functioning tables, has the potential to change how Westerners view newcomers, especially newcomers from the Arab world. It is time that this practice with such a rich history in the Middle East integrates into Western culture.
      </p>
      <h4>Why hospitality?</h4>
      <p>
        Research today repeatedly points to the benefits of contact between residents of a country and immigrants in terms of public perceptions and attitudes toward those newcomers. In a journal article published after 9/11, author and researcher Kathleen Moore writes that “public attitudes about immigration to the United States as a whole are fairly negative, yet people who can count an immigrant among their friends and family are comparatively satisfied with current levels of immigration.” According to her findings, “inter-group relations will benefit from an increase in opportunities for positive interactions across ethnic and religious boundaries.” A 2018 study published in Ethnic and Religious Studies found that “contact between majority and minority group members reduce[s] prejudice towards minority group members (Allport 1954). Based on this theory greater contact with Muslims reduce[s] anti-Muslim sentiment” (Marfouk). This study calls for “public policies that reduce individuals’ fear of immigration and promote tolerance, anti-racism, multiculturalism and positive attitudes to refugees could help to reduce Europeans’ resistance to Muslims’ immigration.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Although beneficial, I would argue that policies are not enough. If people rely on policies and political leaders to facilitate change, they will not take action themselves. It is up to individuals and communities to foster an environment in which immigrants, refugees, and citizens alike can build diverse connections and grow in mutual appreciation and trust. In my own experience, supported by my research, and as indicated by the refugee individuals whom I interviewed, hospitality is the best means by which these connections can be facilitated and the barriers of fear and mistrust broken down.
      </p>
      <h4>What is Hospitality?</h4>
      <p>
        Hundreds, if not thousands of authors and thinkers have developed their own definitions of hospitality. Different contexts can contribute to these different interpretations, and it would be too confusing and take too long to explain them all. The Routledge Handbook of Hospitality Studies might be a good place to start if that’s what you are interested in. But for the purposes of this paper, I am primarily interested in hospitality as it relates to interactions between hosts and guests in a home or homelike setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conrad Lashley, editor of the Handbook, writes in his introduction that in its basic form hospitality in the domestic sphere “involves supplying food, drink, and accommodation to people who are not members of the household” (3). This provision is an “act of friendship” that “creates symbolic ties between people [and] establish[es] bonds among those involved in sharing hospitality” (3). Although an important aspect of hospitality, food, drink, and accommodation are core physical needs, and providing them to people outside the household are, as Kant suggests, a right and a duty due any stranger (Westmoreland 4). According to this interpretation, the only hospitality a stranger should expect is “not to be treated with hostility when he arrives on someone else’s territory” (Westmoreland, quoting Kant, 4). But an absence of hostility, even if coupled with basic provisions, is not hospitality; it is a requirement. Genuine hospitality, that which establishes bonds of friendship and community, extends beyond this fundamental requirement.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> As 18th century lawyer, politician, and food writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin puts it, “To entertain a guest is to make yourself responsible for his happiness as long as he is beneath your roof” (Telfer 57). Hospitality requires a degree of emotional engagement in which a host endeavors to make his or her guests feel safe, at ease, and happy — inasmuch as that host is capable of doing so.

<sup id="fn1">1. To learn more about Kaemingk’s concept of Christian pluralism, please read his book. Even if you’re not interested in Christianity or pluralism, please read his book. It is excellent.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
<sup id="fn2">2. Sometimes, however, a host’s primary motive for hospitality stems from a sense of duty. I would imagine that for some Americans who host immigrants and refugees, a sense of obligation or responsibility to welcome the newcomer would inspire the initial invitation. Even if duty is the sole motive, hospitality is still being extended, and that opens the door for community. I hope that in time, as community develops, the sense of obligation will recede and the joy of hospitality will grow.<a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
