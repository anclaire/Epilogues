      <p>We lived peaceful lives in Syria with our friends and family. We all loved and cared for each other. Then the war started.
      </p><p>
      The fighting moved from neighborhood to neighborhood, and we had to move to find the quietest place to protect our children. So we took our children out of school and moved to Deraa Teyaa, where we stayed for a year. There wasn’t any fighting there, and we tried to enroll our children in school.
      </p><p>
      My oldest daughter Layan was in second grade at that time, but she had missed three years of school because we kept moving. When I tried to enroll her, the administrator said, “I cannot accept Layan because she is older. Marry her off instead, or teach her to knit so she can get a job.”
      </p><p>
      My next child, Amir, was younger, so I was able to enroll him in school. But I struggled for two to three more months to enroll Layan. After lots of pleading, I was able to enroll Layan in the third grade. But after three months, the war began again.
      </p><p>
      There was so much fighting. We didn’t understand what the war was about, who was fighting whom, who we could trust, which side to join. We didn’t even know why each side was fighting. There was so much bombing and shooting in the area. I kept asking my husband, “Where should we go?”
      </p><p>
      At one point, we went four days without electricity, water, or food. The neighbors who lived above us joined us in our home, and we stayed together to keep alive.
      </p><p>
      It was a hard life. I kept asking, “What should I do for my children? How can I keep them alive?” Because when I looked outside the window, I would see a person walking down the street get shot, or I would see a bomb detonate in front of my eyes, and the floor would shake.
      </p><p>
      “What should I do for my children? How can I protect them? If the house were bombed, we would all die.”
      </p><p>
      After a while, the two sides signed a ceasefire agreement, and they gave the families in our area only one hour to flee. So we left with our children at once.
      </p><p>
      As I was leaving, I saw buildings collapsed on the ground. I saw people hurt and dying. As we were leaving, we saw the car in front of us get blown up, along with everyone within it. I held onto my children and prayed.
      </p><p>
      We got out of the car and moved forward on foot. We found a barrier, but we didn’t know if we could cross it or if we would die. We asked the soldiers, but they said, “You can pass, but once you leave this area, you will be killed.”
      </p><p>
      We made the decision to leave, and we made it to my uncle’s home. We stayed with him for ten days, but he already had a family to care for, and we did not want to burden them unnecessarily. So we decided to move to Lebanon.

        We lived in Lebanon for one month. Life was very hard. It was so expensive. We couldn’t enroll our children in school because it cost so much. Bread was expensive, food was expensive.
      </p><p>
        We had four children, and we couldn’t get work. We kept looking and looking for something to do, always asking ourselves, “How will we live?”
      </p><p>
        Even the weather was a challenge — it was cold, and it was hard for us to adapt.
      </p><p>
        People helped us at first, but we didn’t have work. When the help stopped, it was harder to pay for rent and school and food.
      </p><p>
        After a while, I said to my husband, “Enough. There is nothing for us here. Let’s return to Syria.” But I didn’t want to return to Syria — I was afraid. Where would we live? How would we take care of ourselves and our children? What if our children were killed?
      </p><p>
        We returned to Syria, but we were afraid. We had no dreams. We wanted to work. We wanted to live.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Markazi Text', serif; text-align: right; font-size:1.5rem;">خائفا. بس خلاص، ما في حلم. بدنا نشتغل، بدنا حياة
      </p>
      <p>
        My brother suggested we go to Jordan, but I was concerned for the children — for their safety and their future.
      </p><p>
        When we returned to Syria, there was a bombing in the first week, and it wasn’t safe. Our old home was bombed, and all of our official documents were destroyed. So we weren’t even legally documented in the country anymore.
      </p><p>
        We tried to stay with my family, but there was not enough space for everyone. My brother helped us find a temporary place farther away from the bombing, but after about a week there we made plans to go to Jordan.
      </p><p>
        When we arrived in Jordan, I was shocked by how it was. In Syria things were bad, but at least we had a house with a roof over our heads. But in Jordan, it was just a desert, and we stayed in a tent overnight. It was hard — very hard. I wanted to return, but we had to stay.
      </p><p>
        We were told we could leave the camp and go into the country, but we would have to pay money. We decided to pay so we could have a new start.
      </p><p>
        After we settled in Jordan, I tried to enroll my children in school. My eldest daughter was now a seventh or eighth grader with a third grade education.
      </p><p>
        “Impossible; it’s not normal. How can we put a thirteen or fourteen year old in third grade?” the admissions counselors would say.
      </p><p>
        We were in Jordan for four years. Regardless of the amount of help we received from different organizations, things were hard.
        </p><p>
        It was a life, but living it was hard.
      </p><p>
        My daughter went without school for six years. My son was also not enrolled in school. After looking around, I found a charity specifically for Syrian children where I sent them to get some tutoring in English and math and so on. I would go with them and help with the young children.
      </p><p>
        We kept looking for other opportunities, and at last we found an organization that told us we could go to the US.

          I didn’t know anything about America or Europe or how we would travel. It was completely foreign to me. Living in Jordan was not easy, and we struggled to adapt, so how would we adapt to something entirely new?
        </p><p>
          But we had to make the decision for our children's sake. It was hard to see my daughter looking out the window at the other kids going to school when she couldn’t. I felt like I was losing them because they didn’t have an education. The first day of school was like Eid for other kids — they were so excited to get new clothes and go to school — but my children couldn’t experience that. I thought that it would be better for us in the US, so we went through with the interviews.
        </p><p>
          Now, praise God, we are here. My children are studying. This is wonderful.
        </p><p>
          Once we finished with our interviews, we were told we could move to America. We sold everything and bought new clothes were staying in a hotel in Amman awaiting our flight.
        </p><p>
          But then Trump was elected president. They told us, “Trump doesn’t want any refugees.” So we had to get off the plane, and Layan was crying, saying “Now how am I going to learn?”
        </p><p>
          My children were crying because their dreams were crushed.
        </p><p>
          Our lives were going to get better. We were going to go to America. We were going to get an education. But all that was over.
        </p><p>
          We had maybe $50 or $100 left. We were pleading with the organization — I was crying — where would we go? My sister had five children and couldn’t take us in, and we had given up the house we had rented. We had no hope, nothing to do, no money. Eventually we found a place to stay, and my brother paid for rent and my uncle gave us money for furniture. We got the bare basics — mattresses, gas, and electricity.
        </p><p>
          Three or four days later, I was asleep, and my phone rang. It was the organization that had tried to help us resettle. I thought I was dreaming. When I answered the phone, they said my name and my children’s names and asked us, “Do you still want to go to the U.S.?”
        </p><p>
          I couldn’t believe it. I kept asking them, “Are you pranking me?”
        </p><p>
          Then the man on the phone got mad at me. “No, we’re not pranking you,” he said.
        </p><p>
          So I said, “Yes, of course we’ll go.”
        </p><p>
          The man was worried from the tone of my voice that I wouldn’t actually go, but I was serious and assured him of it.
        </p><p>
          Then I called my husband. It was his first day at work. He also thought I was joking. “I’m not in the mood for pranks,” he said.
        </p><p>
          “I’m not joking,” I told him. “Come home.”
        </p><p>
          Even after he came home, he kept asking me if I was serious. I kept assuring him that I was.
        </p><p>
          We waited for the organization to call us back, and they told us they had flights booked for 7 pm that night.
        </p><p>
          We had a lot of things to sell to cover our debt, but the organization said they would handle that for us. But just in case this flight would also fall through, we didn’t tell our landlords that we were leaving. We said we were going just to see what would happen. But when we went to the airport, praise God, we were truly able to come to America.
        </p><p>
          There were so many people in the airport in America. So many signs said, “Welcome to the refugees.” It was so nice. There were people there to tell us where to go.
        </p><p>
          The day that we arrived in America, it was Layan’s birthday. They gave her roses.
        </p><p>
          We were afraid, but at the same time, we were so excited.
        <p style="font-family: 'Markazi Text', serif; text-align: right; font-size:1.5rem;">​​خلاس، هنا حياة رح نبلش. يعني، رح نرجع ان نعيش. كانا مياتين، يعني. …كانت حياة كثير كثير صعبة، وهلا حياة جديدة، أمل جديد
        </p><p>
            Here, our life is going to start. We are going to return to living. We were dead… our life was very, very difficult. But now we have a new life, a new hope. My children are going to learn. We were living in a tent, and now we are in the United States.
        </p><p>
          At the beginning, it wasn’t easy. We didn’t know the language, we didn’t know how to do anything, but fortunately there were many many people around to help us with everything.
        </p><p>
          One day the school called me and said that my daughter had broken her arm. The school was five minutes away, but I didn’t know how to get there, and I didn’t know how to use Uber. So I called a friend who lives in Dc, thirty minutes away, and that friend came all the way from DC to help me pick up my daughter from school.
        </p><p>
          Even though it was hard at first, there were so many people helping us that it was a good experience. Here, you work hard, and the results are guaranteed.
