      <p>We lived peaceful lives in Syria with our friends and family. We all loved and cared for each other. Then the war started.
      </p><p>
      The fighting moved from neighborhood to neighborhood, and we had to move to find the quietest place to protect our children. So we took our children out of school and moved to Deraa Teyaa, where we stayed for a year. There wasn’t any fighting there, and we tried to enroll our children in school.
      </p><p>
      My oldest daughter Layan was in second grade at that time, but she had missed three years of school because we kept moving. When I tried to enroll her, the administrator said, “I cannot accept Layan because she is older. Marry her off instead, or teach her to knit so she can get a job.”
      </p><p>
      My next child, Amir, was younger, so I was able to enroll him in school. But I struggled for two to three more months to enroll Layan. After lots of pleading, I was able to enroll Layan in the third grade. But after three months, the war began again.
      </p><p>
      There was so much fighting. We didn’t understand what the war was about, who was fighting whom, who we could trust, which side to join. We didn’t even know why each side was fighting. There was so much bombing and shooting in the area. I kept asking my husband, “Where should we go?”
      </p><p>
      At one point, we went four days without electricity, water, or food. The neighbors who lived above us joined us in our home, and we stayed together to keep alive.
      </p><p>
      It was a hard life. I kept asking, “What should I do for my children? How can I keep them alive?” Because when I looked outside the window, I would see a person walking down the street get shot, or I would see a bomb detonate in front of my eyes, and the floor would shake.
      </p><p>
      “What should I do for my children? How can I protect them? If the house were bombed, we would all die.”
      </p><p>
      After a while, the two sides signed a ceasefire agreement, and they gave the families in our area only one hour to flee. So we left with our children at once.
      </p><p>
      As I was leaving, I saw buildings collapsed on the ground. I saw people hurt and dying. As we were leaving, we saw the car in front of us get blown up, along with everyone within it. I held onto my children and prayed.
      </p><p>
      We got out of the car and moved forward on foot. We found a barrier, but we didn’t know if we could cross it or if we would die. We asked the soldiers, but they said, “You can pass, but once you leave this area, you will be killed.”
      </p><p>
      We made the decision to leave, and we made it to my uncle’s home. We stayed with him for ten days, but he already had a family to care for, and we did not want to burden them unnecessarily. So we decided to move to Lebanon.
