When you have a job, a steady job, you build your credit, you get your car, you move to another apartment, then you buy a house. When our credit was good, we bought a house.

        Mrs. J, her daughter Luna, and their family are originally from Mosul, Iraq. Because of Mr. and Mrs. J’s affiliation with the US army as interpreters, they had to flee Iraq in 2006 and move to Syria. In 2009, Mrs. J and her three children resettled in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Mr. J joined them the following year. Now, they have purchased a home and obtained citizenship. Luna and her older brother have both studied at Davidson College.

          <b>Mrs. J:</b> My husband and I used to work with the American army as translators in Mosul, Iraq. Then we were threatened because we were working with Americans, with the enemy, so we had to flee the country.
          So we fled from Iraq to Syria, where we stayed for three years as refugees and legal residents until the UN could relocate us to another country. We left Iraq in 2006 and stayed in Syria until 2009.
        </p><p>
          <b>Luna: </b>The first place we came to in the US was New York. Then we took a flight from JFK to Charlotte. The last time we saw anyone from the UN was in JFK. Then when we were coming down the terminal in Charlotte, we saw the person who was responsible for us from Catholic Charities. So from then on, they're responsible for you and for getting you settled. They gave us a fully furnished apartment sponsored by the agency, and they got donations for furniture and food and things like that. So they were there for the whole process of applying for paperwork and your social security number, medication, and your immunizations, because you need to get a full list of immunizations when you come to the States. So they're there for you basically, every step of the way.
