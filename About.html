      <p>Every year, war, violence, and persecution displace thousands of people across the world.
    Those who flee their home countries and cannot return are called <b>refugees.</b><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    The majority of all refugees come from only five countries:
    Afghanistan, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria, and Venezuela.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2020 alone, <b>26 million people</b> were displaced worldwide. The United States resettles only a small percentage of this population — a mere 11,814 (.045%) in 2020. Although the Biden administration is raising the resettlement cap to 125,000 for FY 2022, it may take several years for the government to have the capacity to process a higher volume of applicants.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> In addition, according to the “Report to Congress on Proposed Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021,” the U.S. faces a “continuing backlog of over 1.1 million asylum-seekers who are awaiting adjudication of their claims inside the United States.”<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> These delays have only been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
      Of those refugees who have resettled in the United States, a high percentage come from Burma, the Congo, Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, among other countries.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> As of 2019, the majority of these refugees resettle in Texas, Washington, New York, California, and Ohio.
      </p>
      <p>
      Once refugees have arrived in the U.S., resettlement agencies work with them to provide housing, necessary furniture and clothing, and assistance with food, health, community, and employment needs. Although the U.S. government provides some basic benefits and services, such as Medicaid or Refugee Medical Assistance, supplemental income, and food stamps, this assistance terminates after eight months.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
      The majority of reports like the State Department Congressional Report, Pew Center Research, etc. discuss refugees’ material needs and the assistance that the U.S. government and resettlement agencies provide. However, these reports focus less on refugee experiences after the eight months of assistance have terminated. They also do not focus as much on less quantifiable data such as mental and emotional wellbeing, feelings of connectedness and stability, and experiences of hospitality and welcome or experiences of hostility and exclusion. Most importantly, these reports do not capture the human experiences behind each number in a dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
      As the Biden administration raises the ceiling for refugee admissions to the United States in the coming months and years, it is imperative that current U.S. residents recognize the humanity behind each number so that they can better understand and empathize with their new neighbors.
      My hope is that deeper understanding and empathy will motivate acts of hospitality toward refugees, because sharing a meal or offering a place to stay — <b>extending kindness and generosity in any form </b> — says “you are welcome here” more than any sign or slogan. Furthermore, I believe that we have just as much to receive from those refugees to whom we extend hospitality as we have to give. This has been true in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>This website</b> focuses on the stories of a few refugees who came to the United States within the past fifteen years. Their experiences are unique, yet readers will find many similar threads throughout. This website also explores the meaning and importance of hospitality as it relates to refugee experiences. Finally, this site includes a map with resources to help you learn more and get involved in a local refugee community.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b> "Epilogues" does not give a voice to the voiceless; rather, it seeks to provide a space for those who are already speaking to be heard. </b>Conducting these interviews and translating them was an incredibly humbling and inspirational experience for me. I hope that as others engage with these stories, they will be challenged, humbled, and inspired to pursue genuine hospitality and create spaces of welcome and rest for those who need it.
